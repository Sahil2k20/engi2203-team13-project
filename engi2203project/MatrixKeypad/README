I've written a function to read inputs form the matrix keypad. I put the functions defiinition and declaration 
into a source file and a header file. There is also a project that I included which is simply a program that calls
the getKeyPress() function and prints the correct value to PuTTY. 

I think it would be a good idea to put any other functions we will need that invlove the keypad into these files, and to make similar
files for the other devices we will use.
